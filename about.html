      <p>New-Zealand was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture there approximately 700-750 years ago. Maori society was adapted to a cool, temperate environment rather than a warm, tropical one. Abel Tasman, a Dutch navigator was known to sight New Zealand on 13 December 1642. From the later part of the 18th century, the country was  visited by explorers and other sailors, traders and adventurers on a regular basis. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British People.
In the 21st century, international tourism is a major contributor to the New Zealand, and the service sector more generally has grown. </p>

      <p>The Treaty of Waitangi is the founding document of New Zealand and is an agreement, in Māori and English people, that was made between the British Crown and about 540 Māori chiefs. Taking it's name from the place in the Bay of Islands where it was signed at first, on February 6, 1840. February 6 is now a public holiday in New Zealand. The Treaty is a group of principles on which the Māori and British made a political compact to found a nation state and also to build a stable government in New Zealand. Mainly, the document has three articles. Different understandings of the Treaty by various group of people have long been the subject of debate for a long time.  
Treaty rests with the Waitangi Tribunal, a commission of inquiry that was created(1975) to investigate  breaches of the Treaty by the Crown that are claimed.  At least 2000 claims have been lodged with the tribunal, and a healthy number of major settlements have been achieved.
Copies of the Treaty sheets can be seen on the archives of New -Zealand's website. The original Treaty is on display in the He Tohu exhibition at the Aotearoa National Library of New Zealand in Wellington.  </p>
